# Operating Systems Lab Repository

Welcome to my Operating Systems lab repository! This project showcases three applications developed as part of my coursework.

## Applications

### 1. Sleep
The **Sleep** application demonstrates how processes can be put to sleep for a specified duration. This is useful for simulating delays and managing process execution times in a multitasking environment.

- **Key Features:**
  - Puts the current process to sleep for a given number of seconds.
  - Can handle sleep interruptions.

### 2. Ping Pong
The **Ping Pong** application illustrates inter-process communication (IPC) using signals or message passing. This app simulates a simple ping-pong game where two processes communicate with each other.

- **Key Features:**
  - Two processes that alternately send and receive messages.
  - Demonstrates synchronization and communication between processes.

### 3. Primes
The **Primes** application calculates prime numbers up to a specified limit. This app showcases process forking and concurrent execution by using multiple processes to find prime numbers efficiently.

- **Key Features:**
  - Utilizes forking to create child processes.
  - Efficiently computes prime numbers using multiple processes.
